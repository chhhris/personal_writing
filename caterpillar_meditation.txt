You sure are one
Hungry, hungry caterpillar.

Look at yourself,
munching incessantly
munching along

You are a natural beauty,
Dear caterpillar,
You are perfect,
Just perfect, trust me.

Every moment of your life
Is a reflection of life itself
You are Mother Nature
at her finest

Each segment of your body
Vibrates in a rapid sequence
Of tiny steps, steadily along,
Relentlessly shuffling along
The waxy green surface

The blooming, winding,
Tangled web
Of plant life — the sexy, tangling
Web that was born from a menage a trois

Between earth, soil, the sun shiny rays,
and,
the giver of life itself: Water.

A slurp of cold water feels good when the summmer
California rays burn too hot.
Water is the holiest sacrament

Is it not, dear caterpillar?
Move along, dear caterpillar

Your movements are visible to us
We have filmed your movements
at the slowest frame rates possible
with the highest fidelity cameras
and camera software

We have palced you
under a microscope

I am just marveling
at Mama Nature

Breathe life into your hungry little
caterpillar

It's marvelous
how each step you take
tiny legs rippling beneath your body
the motion which powers those legs
flexing your underbelly muscles

the motion is similar to the sound
of dragging your finger across a piano

Leads us toward that magical
moment in time

When your body transitions
Into a cocoon.

The way you just vibrate your shell
From the crown of your head
Or maybe the lower back of your head,

Down to your neck,
Maybe the top of your spine,

Across your shoulders
Your sexual or reproductive organs
The world inside your mind calms
To a whisper, which melts into the vast
Array of space and time

Trusting in Mama Nature in this moment
Trusting that whatever Mama Nature has in store

For you, for me, and for our children--

Trusting that whatever Mama Nature has in store
For our friends and families, for our bodies,
For the planet

Trusting that this moment is right
Not all moments, just this quiet moment
This moment right now (I am talking to you
Even if you are not listening, or I am boring you
Or I am not making any sense)

As you melt your body into a vessel
Composed of a thin, crystalline shell

Relax into a deep, restful sleep
Not because it's ever safe to relax
Or let your guard down,
Holding all the stress in your body and mind
Sacrificing every bit of yourself

To ensure that this moment unfolds
Amazingly

Once in very blue moon, you must trust
In the moment to keep you safe
Even when every possible danger
Is swirling around you

Even at life's ugliest moments
As much as we suffer for it
Life remains undefeated

[[
  Even if you are defeated, personally
  Even if we are defeated, nationally
  Even if we doom ourselves, as a species
  We fail as stewards of this earthly sphere
  All our best efforts are defeated
  Given to our lowest impulses
]]

[[
  The life
  But only because in this moment,
  That the experience will be beautiful
  In its own way. Even
]]

How the DNA in your body
Knows exactly what to do
Unfurling from the tip
Of your cerebellum

To the very tops
Of your toes

To the bottoms
Of your feet

Unfurling with the same inevitability
As time itself

Until the rough mixture
Of bodily fluids

Wrapped around you
Like a sleeping bag

Your cocoon, just an incredible
Display of raw biology

Enthralling your entire body
Gradually smooths and hardens,

Made perfect, beneath the winds
and rhythms of time

Your smooth cocoon shell
Is now an exquisitely
Manufactured time capsule

You release inside your cocoon now
You let go of any conception about what was
Or what has yet to be

You luxuriate in your pure ingredients
consumed in service to
Creating this shell

You soak in the earth’s nutrients,
from all the green plant life that you munched
on your way to butterfly-ness.

You soak in all of the sun’s warmth,
Already baked into the waxy, pulpy greenery

You absorb every last molecule of moisture
You can from your hard, smooth, green
cocoon shell, you patiently wait
Until your cocoon has emptied itself

your cocoon has crystalized
into the thinnest, most transparent
window to the world shell,

For your beauty, your poise, the miracle
Of your life, dear caterpillar, dear cocoon,

Dear butterfly, dear empty shell, dear butterfly wings
Still waking up, soft and pliable are those wings
Only very recently having emerged from the little
Cocoon, which under a certain light kinda looks
Like a uterus, in fact.

Your wings do not fully know themselves,
not yet; having only just unfolded themselves,
into the light.

Oh yes, dear butterfly,
Who were once a hungry little caterpillar
Who steadily embarked upon the journey
of a lifetime, to achieve one of the most miraculous

Transformations in all of nature.
Oh yes, dear caterpillar,

We have poured over each step
In your journey with our minds

We have had a fellow by the name of
Sir David Attenborough
narrate each exquisite moment
Of your life

We fell in love with you,
dear caterpillar,
We fell in love with you,
When you transformed into your butterfly-ness,

Dear caterpillar, we could hardly believe
That our hearts could burst with such wonder
Our love deepened for you,

We did not miss anything about your hungry
Little caterpillar body, even as we loved
To reminisce about it, to remind ourselves
Of what once was,

To live each moment touched with sorrow
Knowing there exists a day
When your wings will cease to flap
Amid the gentle breeze
